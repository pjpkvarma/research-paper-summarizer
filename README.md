# Research Paper Summarizer

A web-based tool that allows users to upload research papers in PDF format and receive concise, readable summaries using transformer-based models. Built using Streamlit, Hugging Face Transformers, and deployed on Render, this tool is designed to help students, researchers, and professionals quickly grasp the core content of lengthy academic documents.

## üß† How It Works

1. The PDF is parsed and converted to raw text.
2. Text is split into ~700-word chunks, respecting the token limits of the summarizer model.
3. Each chunk is passed through a transformer summarization model.
4. The final output is a merged list of clean, structured summaries.
